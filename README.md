# RecommendationSamples
 
In this repository, we show some examples or details about sampled data used in our experiment.

# [OJNUAA](https://github.com/melond/RecommendationSamples/tree/main/OJNUAA):
[submission.rar](https://github.com/melond/RecommendationSamples/blob/main/OJNUAA/submission.rar) includes the original source files of OJNUAA, it records the submitted source files and their related information. We have filtered and organized these code files for recommendation task, and [200.rar](https://github.com/melond/RecommendationSamples/blob/main/OJNUAA/200.rar) contains the dataset we used in our experiment. We randomly choose 20 files under each folder as queries. [recommendNUAA.py](https://github.com/melond/RecommendationSamples/blob/main/OJNUAA/recommendNUAA.py) shows the general process.

# [OJSystem](https://github.com/melond/RecommendationSamples/tree/main/OJSystem):
Similar as OJNUAA, we uploaded the [recommending process](https://github.com/melond/RecommendationSamples/blob/main/OJSystem/recommend.py).

# [IJaDataset](https://github.com/melond/RecommendationSamples/tree/main/IJaDataset):
The IJaDataset can be found in http://secold.org/projects/seclone.
We only used the files that have been tagged and between 20 and 30 lines. This part of experiments are mostly done by manual effort, including the cutting and verification, so we only randomly choose 300 files from the dataset. Here we give a example to show the orginal code file and qeury file.
